summary: In this work, I extending permutation-free kernel two-sample test into the semi-supervised setting, guaranteeing its asymptotic properties under the null and alternative.
abstract: In recent years, significant advancements in statistics and machine learning have led to the
development of semi-supervised methodologies that leverage both labeled and unlabeled data.
One prominent area of interest within this domain is statistical inference like two-sample test.
In this paper, we extend existing kernel two-sample testing methods in semi-supervised setting
based on sample-splitting and studentization which utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data. We
prove that the corresponding statistic has a standard Gaussian asymptotic distribution under
the null given certain conditions. Additionally, we prove that under stricter conditions, the
statistic has a Gaussian limiting distribution either the case with or without unlabeled data.
Furthermore, we show the consistency of the suggested test against fixed alternative, and obtain
explicit expression of power when using bilinear kernel. We provide a numerical analysis and
experimental results to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
